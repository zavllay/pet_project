A cat rubs against people not only to be affectionate but also to mark out its territory with scent glands around its face. The tail area and paws also carry the catâ€™s scent.
The largest cat breed is the Ragdoll. Male Ragdolls weigh between 12 and 20 lbs (5.4-9.0 k). Females weigh between 10 and 15 lbs (4.5-6.8 k).
A cat's jaw has only up and down motion; it does not have any lateral, side to side motion, like dogs and humans.
A cat has the ability to rotate their ears 180 degrees,with the help of 32 muscles that they use to control them.
